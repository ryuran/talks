  Hi Folks!

  I'm happy to be here! I gave this talk for the first time 3 years ago. I'm the first one to be surprised by its longevity. More than ever, it's still relevant to talk about cryptography.

  It's my first time as a speaker in the USA, so thank you very much for being here.

  Let's talk about ciphers now!
