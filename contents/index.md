# m4dz' talks

This page list my talks resources and videos. Unfortunately, as I'm never satisfied, some of them are in a rewriting state, especially concerning their design (they mainly are in the [legacy section](#legacy)). But, fortunately, their contents are readable and, I hope, relevant enough.

As the content is still moving, this page is just here to give some content links, and yet a little bit rough. I hope you won't blame me for that and the lack of styling but, hey, at least it's responsive :Pâ€¦
