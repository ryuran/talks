## So, what do we do now?

So, time to conclude (because the coffee is cooling right now). What do we do, now?

Never play the sorcerer's apprentice

First: never ever play the sorcerer's apprentice. Cryptography is a hard job, dedicated to maths, which require many skills that most people can't pretend to have, myself included. Don't try to reinvent the wheel, be confident to crypto-developers, and use their open source work.

Never forget that:

1. Security has an inverse relation to ease of use
2. Security has a cost

???

Second: never forget that security has an inverse relation to simplicity. The more you increase your security, the more it will be complicated to use to your users. It means security come at a cost. In time, in UX, in money. You have to adjust the cursor between all those params.

Stop being scared, and protect

My last slide is about this Reddit post. It came when Ashley Madison, the dating platform, leaked its database with personal data about its customers.

This guy said that he lived in the USA for studies. He's gay and used Ashley Madison platform for dating. Now, he's returned in its country, Saudi Arabia, where homosexuality is punished by death. He's scared for his life now because the data leak can reveal who he is, what is its sexual orientation, and where he lives.

I don't think that Ashley Madison developers though that sometime they may compromise somebody's life when they wrote their codebase. However, it is. So, even if security isn't a simple thing, it's time to stop to be scared, and to protect.

Thank you.
