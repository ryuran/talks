  Hi Everyone!

  Thank you for having me today, and thank you for coming.

  I'm thrilled to give this talk for the first time in the USA at Connect.Tech. I gave it for the first time 3 years ago. I'm still surprised by its longevity, but more than ever, we need to talk about cryptography.

  So, let's talk about ciphers!
